// This class is a compressed storage backend for LinePositionArray
// It emulates the interface of a vector, but take advantage of the nature
// of the stored data (increasing end of line addresses) to apply some
// compression in memory, while still providing fast, constant-time look-up.

/* The current algorithm takes advantage of the fact most lines are reasonably
 * short, it codes each line on:
 * - Line < 127 bytes    : 1 byte
 * - 127 < line < 16383  : 2 bytes
 * - line > 16383        : 6 bytes (or 10 bytes)
 * Uncompressed backend stores line on 4 bytes or 8 bytes.
 *
 * The algorithm is quite simple, the file is first divided in two parts:
 * - The lines whose end are located before UINT32_MAX
 * - The lines whose end are located after UINT32_MAX
 * Those end of lines are stored separately in the table32 and the table64
 * respectively.
 *
 * The EOL list is then divided in blocks of BLOCK_SIZE (128) lines.
 * A block index vector (per table) contains pointers to each block.
 *
 * Each block is then defined as such:
 * Block32 (sizes in byte)
 * 00 - Absolute EOF address (4 bytes)
 * 04 - ( 0xxx xxxx  if second line is < 127 ) (1 byte, relative)
 *    - ( 10xx xxxx
 *        xxxx xxxx  if second line is < 16383 ) (2 bytes, relative)
 *    - ( 1111 1111
 *        xxxx xxxx
 *        xxxx xxxx  if second line is > 16383 ) (6 bytes, absolute)
 * ...
 * (126 more lines)
 *
 * Block64 (sizes in byte)
 * 00 - Absolute EOF address (8 bytes)
 * 08 - ( 0xxx xxxx  if second line is < 127 ) (1 byte, relative)
 *    - ( 10xx xxxx
 *        xxxx xxxx  if second line is < 16383 ) (2 bytes, relative)
 *    - ( 1111 1111
 *        xxxx xxxx
 *        xxxx xxxx
 *        xxxx xxxx
 *        xxxx xxxx  if second line is > 16383 ) (10 bytes, absolute)
 * ...
 * (126 more lines)
 *
 * Absolute addressing has been adopted for line > 16383 to bound memory usage in case
 * of pathologically long (MBs or GBs) lines, even if it is a bit less efficient for
 * long-ish (30 KB) lines.
 *
 * The table32 always starts at 0, the table64 starts at first_long_line_
